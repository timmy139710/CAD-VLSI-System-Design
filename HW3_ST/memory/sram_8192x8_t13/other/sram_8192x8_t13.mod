 *
 *      Modeling Assumptions: This library contains a black box description
 *          for a memory element.  At the library level, a
 *          default_max_transition constraint is set to the maximum
 *          characterized input slew.  Each output has a max_capacitance
 *          constraint set to the highest characterized output load.
 *          Different modes are defined in order to disable false path
 *          during the specific mode activation when doing static timing analysis. 
 *
 *
 *      Modeling Limitations: This stamp does not include power information.
 *          Due to limitations of the stamp modeling, some data reduction was
 *          necessary.  When reducing data, minimum values were chosen for the
 *          fast case corner and maximum values were used for the typical and
 *          best case corners.  It is recommended that critical timing and
 *          setup and hold times be checked at all corners.
 *
 *      Known Bugs: None.
 *
 *      Known Work Arounds: N/A
